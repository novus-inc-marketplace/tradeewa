 Setting Up PostgreSQL for TradeEwa

  This guide will walk you through installing PostgreSQL, creating a dedicated database and user for your project, and configuring your FastAPI backend to connect to  
  it.

  Step 1: Install PostgreSQL

  For Windows (Recommended Method: Official Installer)

   1. Download the Installer: Go to the official PostgreSQL downloads page: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ (https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
   2. Run the Installer:
       * Choose the latest stable version (e.g., PostgreSQL 16.x).
       * Follow the installation wizard.
       * Crucial Step: Set a strong password for the `postgres` superuser. Remember this password; you'll need it.
       * Accept the default ports (usually 5432).
       * Select the components to install. Ensure "PostgreSQL Server" and "pgAdmin 4" are selected. pgAdmin 4 is a graphical administration tool that will make        
         management easier.
       * Complete the installation.

  Step 2: Create a Database and User for TradeEwa using pgAdmin 4

  pgAdmin 4 is a powerful graphical interface for managing your PostgreSQL databases.

   1. Launch pgAdmin 4: After installation, search for and open "pgAdmin 4".
   2. Connect to Server:
       * In the left sidebar, under "Servers," you should see "PostgreSQL <version number>".
       * Double-click it, and it will ask for the password you set for the postgres superuser during installation. Enter it.
   3. Create a New Login/Group Role (User):
       * Right-click on "Login/Group Roles" (under your server) -> "Create" -> "Login/Group Role...".
       * General Tab:
           * Name: tradeewa_user (or any username you prefer, but remember it).
       * Definition Tab:
           * Password: Set a strong password for this user (e.g., tradeewa_password). Remember this!
       * Privileges Tab:
           * Ensure "Can login?" is set to Yes.
       * Click "Save".
   4. Create a New Database:
       * Right-click on "Databases" (under your server) -> "Create" -> "Database...".
       * General Tab:
           * Database: tradeewa_db (or any database name you prefer).
           * Owner: Select the tradeewa_user you just created from the dropdown.
       * Click "Save".

  Now you have a dedicated user (tradeewa_user) and a database (tradeewa_db) owned by that user.

  Step 3: Configure Your FastAPI Backend

  You need to update the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL in backend/database.py with the connection details for your new database.

   1. Open `backend/database.py`:
       * The current line is: SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@postgresserver/db"
   2. Update the URL: Change it to the following format, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

   1     SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://tradeewa_user:tradeewa_password@localhost:5432/tradeewa_db"

       * tradeewa_user: The username you created in pgAdmin.
       * tradeewa_password: The password for tradeewa_user.
       * localhost: Your database server's host (since it's on your machine).
       * 5432: The default PostgreSQL port (if you changed it during installation, use your custom port).
       * tradeewa_db: The database name you created in pgAdmin.

  Step 4: Verify the Installation and Connection

   1. Start the Backend:
       * Open your terminal in the tradeewa/backend directory.
       * Activate your virtual environment: .\venv\Scripts\activate
       * Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn: uvicorn main:app --reload
       * You should see output indicating that the server is running (e.g., "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)").
       * Check for errors: If there are any errors related to database connection, double-check your SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL in backend/database.py and ensure
         PostgreSQL is running.

   2. Test the Signup Endpoint:
       * Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs (the FastAPI interactive documentation).
       * Find the POST /users/ endpoint.
       * Click "Try it out".
       * Provide an email and password in the request body.
       * Click "Execute".
       * Expected Result: You should get a 200 OK response with the new user's details. If you get a 500 Internal Server Error, check the backend console for
         database-related error messages.

   3. Verify in pgAdmin 4:
       * In pgAdmin 4, expand "Databases" -> tradeewa_db -> "Schemas" -> "public" -> "Tables".
       * You should see a users table and a verification_tokens table.
       * Right-click on the users table -> "View/Edit Data" -> "All Rows". You should see the user you just created via the API.

  This completes the PostgreSQL setup and initial verification.

  Once you have set up PostgreSQL and confirmed the backend can connect and create users, please let me know, and we can proceed with the next steps for frontend email

  This guide covers PostgreSQL installation, database/user creation, and FastAPI backend configuration.

  Step 1: Install PostgreSQL

  For Windows (Official Installer Recommended)

   1. Download: Get the installer from https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/ (https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
   2. Install:
       * Choose the latest stable version (e.g., PostgreSQL 16.x).
       * Follow the wizard, setting a strong password for the `postgres` superuser (remember it).
       * Accept default port (5432).
       * Ensure "PostgreSQL Server" and "pgAdmin 4" are selected.
       * Complete the installation.

  Step 2: Create a Database and User with pgAdmin 4

   1. Launch pgAdmin 4.
   2. Connect to Server: Double-click "PostgreSQL <version>" under "Servers", then enter your postgres superuser password.
   3. Create Login/Group Role (User):
       * Right-click "Login/Group Roles" -> "Create" -> "Login/Group Role...".
       * General Tab: Name it tradeewa_user.
       * Definition Tab: Set a strong password (e.g., tradeewa_password).
       * Privileges Tab: "Can login?" -> Yes.
       * Click "Save".
   4. Create Database:
       * Right-click "Databases" -> "Create" -> "Database...".
       * General Tab:
           * Database: tradeewa_db.
           * Owner: Select tradeewa_user.
       * Click "Save".

  Step 3: Configure Your FastAPI Backend

  Update backend/database.py:

   1. Open `backend/database.py`.
   2. Change `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL`:

   1     SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://tradeewa_user:tradeewa_password@localhost:5432/tradeewa_db"
      Replace tradeewa_user, tradeewa_password, and tradeewa_db with your actual values if different.

  Step 4: Verify Installation and Connection

   1. Start Backend:
       * In tradeewa/backend: .\venv\Scripts\activate
       * Then: uvicorn main:app --reload
       * Confirm server runs, check for connection errors.

   2. Test Signup Endpoint:
       * Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
       * Find POST /users/, click "Try it out".
       * Enter email and password, click "Execute".
       * Expect a 200 OK response. 500 Internal Server Error means database issues.

   3. Verify in pgAdmin 4:
       * Expand tradeewa_db -> "Schemas" -> "public" -> "Tables".
       * Confirm users and verification_tokens tables exist.
       * Right-click users -> "View/Edit Data" -> "All Rows" to see your new user.
